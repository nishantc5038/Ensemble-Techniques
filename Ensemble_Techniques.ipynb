        "1. What is Ensemble Learning in machine learning? Explain the key idea\n",
        "behind it.\n",
        "   - Ensemble learning combines multiple machine learning models (called base learners or weak learners) to produce a single, more accurate and robust prediction than any individual model could achieve alone.\n",
        "Key idea\n",
        "The core principle is that a group of diverse models, each with its own biases and errors, can compensate for each other's weaknesses when their predictions are aggregated—reducing overall variance and bias.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?\n",
        "   - Bagging (Bootstrap AGGregatING):\n",
        "Creates multiple bootstrap samples from training data\n",
        "Trains identical models independently on each sample\n",
        "Combines predictions via majority vote (classification) or averaging (regression)\n",
        "Example: Random Forest (adds feature randomness too)\n",
        "\n",
        "Boosting:\n",
        "Starts with full dataset, trains first weak learner\n",
        "Increases weights of misclassified samples for next learner\n",
        "Each subsequent model focuses on previous errors\n",
        "Final prediction is weighted combination\n",
        "Examples: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is bootstrap sampling and what role does it play in Bagging methods\n",
        "like Random Forest?\n",
        "   - Bootstrap sampling is a resampling technique that creates multiple training datasets by randomly drawing samples from the original dataset with replacement, where each bootstrap sample has the same size as the original data. About 63.2% of the samples in each bootstrap set are unique, with the rest being duplicates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Role in Bagging (e.g., Random Forest)\n",
        "Creates diversity: Each tree in Random Forest is trained on a different bootstrap sample, ensuring models see slightly different data and make uncorrelated errors.\n",
        "Reduces variance: Since each tree votes independently on varied data views, final predictions (majority vote) average out individual tree noise/overfitting.\n",
        "Out-of-bag (OOB) validation: ~37% of data is left out of each bootstrap sample naturally, used to estimate ensemble performance without a separate validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What are Out-of-Bag (OOB) samples and how is OOB score used to\n",
        "evaluate ensemble models?\n",
        "   - Out-of-Bag (OOB) samples are the data points that are not selected in the bootstrap sampling process for a particular tree in bagging-based ensembles like Random Forest—roughly 37% of the original dataset per tree. The OOB score uses these naturally held-out samples to provide an internal validation metric without needing a separate test set.\n",
        "Advantages of OOB score\n",
        "No data splitting needed: Uses full training set for both training and validation\n",
        "Unbiased estimate: Comparable to cross-validation accuracy, often slightly optimistic\n",
        "Fast: Computed during training as byproduct of bootstrap process\n",
        "Variable importance: Can compute feature importance using only OOB samples.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Compare feature importance analysis in a single Decision Tree vs. a\n",
        "Random Forest.\n",
        "   - Single Decision Tree\n",
        "Feature importance is calculated as the total reduction in impurity (Gini/entropy) from all splits using that feature, weighted by the proportion of samples reaching each split node, then normalized to sum to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bias: Favors features with many unique values (appear higher in tree)\n",
        "Instability: Single tree easily overfits, making importances unreliable.\n",
        "  - Random Forest\n",
        "  Stability: Bootstrap + feature randomness → consistent rankings\n",
        "Reduced bias: Aggregation smooths out single-tree preferences\n",
